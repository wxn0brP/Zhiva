# Zhiva

Zhiva is a framework for creating desktop applications using web technologies.

## Project Goals

Zhiva aims to combine the convenience of creating web-based interfaces with the ability to run as a desktop application. The project explores the integration possibilities of web technologies with the native system environment.

## Project Structure

The main Zhiva repository is a multirepo containing various components:

- `master`: Main repository with documentation and general description.
- `base-lib`: Implementation of the base library/foundation for Zhiva. [Zhiva-base-lib](https://github.com/wxn0brP/Zhiva-base-lib)
- `native`: Native components for managing windows and interacting with the operating system. [Zhiva-native](https://github.com/wxn0brP/Zhiva-native)
- `scripts`: Utility scripts for setting up and running the project. [Zhiva-scripts](https://github.com/wxn0brP/Zhiva-scripts)

## Status

The project is currently in the PoC/WIP phase. The entire structure and API are under exploration and may change significantly in the future.
